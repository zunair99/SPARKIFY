# Sparkify ETL Pipeline

### This Data Pipeline leverages PySpark and AWS S3 buckets to create a star-schema data model, ready for ingestion by a visualization platform to develop metrics.

#### All components of the data pipeleline have been broken apart into their respective categories to allow for faster bug-fixing and better organization of code.
##### A consolidated version of the script containing all the code can be found in sparkify_etl.py

Input data that was landed in the S3 bucket can be found in the input_data folder.
